# SailorMod 1.8.9

SailorMod is a client written/skidded from a tutorial (quickdaffy's) for me to get a better grasp on java/mcp modding.

# Should you use it?

absolutely not, this client is no different from any other client and is actually way worse, again this inst a client that i would even consider
releasing or making some big thing, its just a small java project for me to learn 1.8 mcp.

# Should i skid it?

no. ur skidding a skid if you skid this lol.
